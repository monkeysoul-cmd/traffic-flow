# **App Name**: UrbanFlow

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Traffic Analysis: Analyze real-time traffic data from cameras and IoT sensors. Integrate with existing traffic camera networks using OpenCV for vehicle detection and counting.
- Predictive Congestion Modeling: Use machine learning to predict traffic bottlenecks based on historical and real-time data. Use Reinforcement Learning to anticipate and react to changes in traffic patterns. The machine learning system acts as a decision-making tool, using rules, data and probability to provide suggestions to downstream actions.
- Adaptive Signal Timing: Dynamically adjust traffic signal timings based on predicted traffic conditions.
- Interactive Dashboard: Provide a dashboard for traffic authorities to monitor traffic flow, view predictions, and manually adjust signal timings if needed. Include visualizations for traffic density, average speeds, and congestion hotspots.
- Simulation Environment: Simulate urban traffic environments to test and validate the effectiveness of the adaptive signal timing algorithms.
- Incident Detection: Automatically detect traffic incidents (accidents, road closures) from camera feeds and sensor data.
- Login Dashboard: Create a login dashboard for authentication and user management.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to represent calm and controlled traffic flow. This reflects reliability without being overly stimulating.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a clean, neutral backdrop for data visualization.
- Accent color: Orange (#FFA07A) is used sparingly to highlight important alerts and interactive elements, signifying urgency and action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font. Clean and modern look.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent different traffic elements, like cars, signals, and incidents.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize the dashboard elements, ensuring information is easily scannable.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate changes in traffic conditions, providing visual feedback to the user.
